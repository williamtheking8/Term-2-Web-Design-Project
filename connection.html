		<div class="Paragraph"> <p> I grew up with the Nintendo Wii and my favourite game we had on that console was Super Smash Bros Brawl.
		It was nowhere near perfect (as I would learn later) but i fell in love with the characters and fighting style of the game.
		I didn't have a Wii U which housed the game generally known as Smash 4 but when Ultimate came out for the Switch I loved it.
		The fighting style is unique and it feels amazing to send people flying with a strong attack. Also the vast cast of famous characters 
		lets you pick and choose who you want to play and allows for many different play styles. </p> </div>
			
			<h2 class="Mini">  Experiences  </h2>  
		<div class="Paragraph">	<p> Most of my experiences are playing with my brother and losing most of the time.
			I have many fond memories of playing against someone online and spiking them (risky move that sends them straight down) into the blast zone and winning.
			I also love the Single Player mode, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WShCN-AYHqA"> World of Light </a>, right now I'm doing a no-spirit run which basically means I deal little damage and I lose quickly.
			Overall my experiences have been good and that is what drives me to come back to the game and keep playing.  </p> </div>

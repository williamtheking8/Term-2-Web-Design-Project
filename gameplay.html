		<div class="Paragraph"> <p> After you picked your character you will all spawn in on a stage or battlefield.
		 To move it's just your left stick to move in a direction (and is used for attacks) and Y to jump. 
		When you get hit with a move your percent increases an amount depending on the damage of the move, you will also get knocked back 
		a certain distance depending on the move. Depending on how much percentage you have you will get knocked back further. 
		After your opponent has reached about 100% they will be knocked far and away with each move.		
		At this time you should start using smash attacks (A + direction inputted at same time on ground)to get them into the blast-zone.
		In this case you may want to Shield the attacks. You can do so by holding ZR/ZL this shield will surround you and protect your character from getting hit. 
		But with each hit the shield shrinks and may not cover your character anymore and it needs time to grow again. If your shield shrinks enough from a strong attack it may break, this will stun you for many seconds and let your opponent charge an attack.
		If you don't want to risk your shield breaking you can roll, just by holding the shield out and inputting a direction (Left or Right). This will roll your character and make them invincible for a very short time. Doing this to often will slow the speed of the rolls.
		In the air you can press ZR/ZL and a direction ( if you want ) and launch your character a short distance in that direction while making you invincible for a very short time. </div class="Paragraph">

		<td> A + Up </td> <td> Does an attack upwards that can be used to hit aerial opponents, some character's can hit grounded ones but not all. </td>

		<td> A + Forward (Air) </td> <td> Does in attack in that direction (NOTE: forward is whatever direction your character is facing before the move)  </td>
		</tr>

		<td> A + Back (Air) </td> <td> Usually a very different move than the forward variant some are stonger others weaker (NOTE: Back is opposite to whatever direction you were facing before the move) </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td> A + Down (Air) </td> <td> A downward attack that is very good when you are above the enemy, some character's attack spikes ( sends opponent downward very fast, which can be used offstage to send them to blastzone) </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td> A + Up (Air) </td> <td> An upward attack that is very good for air to air combat when you are below your opponent </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td> A + L/R (at same time) </td> <td> Strong sideways attack (whichever way you inputed) that deals a lot of damage and can send players flying (Leaves you vulnerable if you miss(takes a while to finish the attack) </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td> A + Up (at same time) </td> <td> Stong upward attack and a great way to hit aerial opponents as they try to land. Leaves you vulnerable to attacks if you miss (takes a while to finish the attack)   </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td> A + Down (at same time)   </td> <td> Usually either a single downward attack infront of you OR an attack that hits people both to your left and right. Leaves you vulnerable to attacks if you miss (takes a while to finish the attack)  </td>

		<tr>
		<td> B  </td> <td> Usually a projectile or chargable move that can be unleashed later by pressing B again </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td> B + Right/Left </td> <td> Sometimes a projectile and other times an attack that moves you in that direction </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td> B + Down </td> <td> Often is a move that doesn't move you, can give you a certain item or can be a counter (if attacked the opponent gets attacked by you instead) </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td> B + Up </td> <td> Your "Recovery", it's a move that sends you upward and is ideal for getting back on stage after being launched off it </td>
